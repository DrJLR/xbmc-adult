= Guidelines for developers and contributors =
In general if you want new sites added please submit them as additions to the videodevil plugin. Create a new issue and attach the patch to the issue report.

Only create a new plugin if there is a good reason why it can't be added to videodevil.

If you would like to submit changes say
  * What you are doing. Sometimes implementation does not match design
  * Why you are making this change. Why should the changes be made to the code.

We will try to fix broken plugins or sites but sometimes we will just delete them if there is no interest or the fix is too complex.

In all cases make sure you follow the coding standards. If you are submitting changes use diff to create a patch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix)#Usage_examples


= Coding standards =
Pay particular attention to *indentation* and *line length*

in the topmost directory and commit all the resulting changes.
