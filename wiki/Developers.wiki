= Guidelines for developers and contributors =
In general if you want new sites added please submit them as additions to the videodevil plugin. Create a new issue and attach the patch to the issue report.

Only create a new plugin if there is a good reason why it can't be added to videodevil.

We will try to fix broken plugins or sites but sometimes we will just delete them if there is no interest or the fix is too complex.

In all cases make sure you follow the coding standards.


= Coding standards =
Pay particular attention to *indentation* and *line length*

= Committing code =
Make sure to update `addon.xml` in the plugin directory then run 
{{{
python addons_xml_generator.py
}}}
in the topmost directory and commit all the resulting changes.
